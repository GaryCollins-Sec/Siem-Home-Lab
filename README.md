# Detection Engineering & Network Analysis Lab

## Objective
Built a home SIEM lab to evaluate host-based detection capabilities using Wazuh. The environment simulated real-world attacker activity from a Kali Linux system targeting an Ubuntu endpoint. The goal was to assess telemetry visibility, alert fidelity, and detection gaps rather than achieve perfect alerting.

### Skills Learned
- Deployment & Enrollment: You learned how to deploy a complex SIEM (Wazuh) and enroll endpoints using agents. This demonstrates I can manage the "plumbing" of a security stack.
- Rule Tuning & Noise Reduction: One of the most valued skills in a SOC is the ability to "silence the noise." By identifying and suppressing Rule 510, you demonstrated that you can prevent alert fatigue and focus on high-fidelity threats.
- Custom Rule Creation: You learned how to write and modify XML rules to escalate security levels based on frequency and timeframe— essential for catching sophisticated brute-force attacks.
- Tool Proficiency: I gained hands-on experience with Hydra and Nmap, the industry standards for password cracking and network discovery.
- Attack Patterns: I didn't just run a command; you learned what those attacks look like "on the wire" and in the logs. This "Attacker Mindset" helps me become a better defender.
- Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK: I learned to categorize alerts using a professional framework.
- Log Correlation: I practiced "connecting the dots" between a source IP in Kali and a failed login event on Ubuntu. This is the core of incident investigation.
- Virtual Networking: I successfully managed communication between three different VMs (Kali, Ubuntu, and Wazuh OVA), which requires an understanding of IP addressing, subnets, and host-only networking.


### Tools Used
- Wazuh (SIEM/XDR): Centralized log management, correlation, and intrusion detection.
- Wazuh Agent: Installed on the endpoint to monitor system logs (auth.log), file integrity, and running processes.
- Kali Linux: The primary offensive platform used for adversary emulation.
- Hydra: High-speed network logon cracker used to simulate SSH brute-force attacks.
- Nmap (Network Mapper): Used for network discovery and security auditing to trigger "multiple connection" alerts.
- Oracle VirtualBox: Hosted the virtualized lab environment.
- Ubuntu Server 24.04: Acted as the victim/target endpoint.
- Linux CLI / Bash Scripting: Used for automated log generation, rule configuration, and system administration.

Goal: Ensure the Ubuntu victim endpoint is connected and correctly reporting logs.
Action: Used ip a to validate IP assignment and network connectivity.

Caption:
Validated the Ubuntu victim endpoint’s network identity using ip a, confirming reliable connectivity and telemetry forwarding to the Wazuh Manager.

Goal: Establish baseline connectivity and confirm the lab environment is ready for simulation.
Action: Pinged the victim from Kali to verify communication and latency.

Caption:
Performed baseline network reconnaissance from the Kali attacker via ping, confirming connectivity for subsequent simulated attacks and reliable telemetry ingestion by Wazuh.

Goal: Generate network scanning activity to validate SIEM detection of reconnaissance behavior.
Action: Executed nmap -A -T4 for OS detection, service enumeration, and traceroute.

Caption:
Executed an aggressive Nmap scan from Kali to simulate active reconnaissance and generate multiple connection attempts, validating Wazuh’s ability to detect scanning behavior.

Goal: Monitor endpoint anomalies and enforce security policies while ensuring compliance alignment.
Action: Configured Rootcheck and AppArmor for anomaly detection and policy enforcement. Monitored events for suspicious processes and unauthorized access attempts.

Wazuh SIEM performing deep-level auditing of an Ubuntu victim endpoint via host-based anomaly detection and kernel-level policy enforcement. Monitoring Rootcheck (Rule 510) and AppArmor (Rule 52002) events provided visibility into suspicious system behavior and unauthorized process attempts. Activities were mapped to PCI DSS (10.6.1, 10.2.6) and GDPR compliance standards, demonstrating the transformation of raw endpoint telemetry into actionable, audit-ready security intelligence.

### Lessons Learned:

- Telemetry gaps matter: Some attack activity did not trigger alerts due to missing or misconfigured audit logs, highlighting the importance of complete endpoint coverage.

- Rule tuning is critical: Default Wazuh rules generated false positives; tuning improved alert fidelity.

- Detection vs. response: Detecting events is only the first step—mapping alerts to MITRE ATT&CK and compliance standards ensures actionable intelligence.

- Simulated attacks are valuable: Controlled Hydra and Nmap simulations allowed safe testing without risking real systems.

- Continuous improvement: Even a well-configured SIEM requires iterative testing, analysis, and updates to maintain effective coverage.
